Eric Ly's Portfolio

I am a fresh computer science major here at CalState Fullerton and I plan on gradutating in either 2028 or 2029.

Favorite labs of CPSC 120:

Lab 7 was my favorite because I did not know how command lines actually work until I did the lab, which gave me a good explanation of it. I helped my partner a good amount of time and we completed it without much of a struggle. Through that lab, I was able to learn how to write arguments that go through all the info given and prints out a result, which in this case, took the days, time, and street name and printed out whether we could park there or not.

Lab 6 part 1 was another of my favorites because it was a rather simple one but for some reason it felt absolutely amazing when we finished. I learned how to write command lines and this lab helped me implement it. We finished and we did a bunch of tests, playing and messing around with the result, it was a fun lab for sure.

Lab 4 in general was one of my favorites as well due to the sheer amount of struggling we went through just to finish it. For part 1, we had to convert measurements and then divide them and the print them out. We were stuck on the conversion for so long. After the whole week, the following Tuesday before it was due, we managed to finish and it was just an amazing sensation to get that lab done with. Afterwards, seeing what we did wrong, I was able to understand more and learn how to properly format it.
